# 3semestrPROGINcosmos
This repository was created for our beloved professor Alice Dmitrievna. I will protect laboratory in its subject. The basis of the repository is my old Cosmos project

Cosmos - project about physical simulation of the gravitational interaction of celestial bodies and heavenly mechanics in general. This is my personal project, which I am engaged in love for space

The project was launched in 2023, and at the time of 2025 was in a frozen state with some simulation shortcomings and unfinished functionality, insufficient to be called a full-fledged simulation
